> Maybe a simpler target is to try to get the inner part of my object to be brighter than the outer part (without having a (transparent) outer glow) with a (variable) gradient to try to mimic a glow effect. 

Agree with you. We need to know how to play the luminous intensity.

> You mentioned that you achieved that in the video with the RTX framework.

Are you talking with me? I did not say that.

> In my case, I just have a static image where I want to illuminate certain objects (so no animation). 

Then, try GIMP?

> Is this something I can achieve with whatâ€™s currently in VTK / ParaView? 

@experts

> Or was your point that even this is not possible without hacking around at the VTK level?

I am also new to VTK level.

> Any experiences with importing the VTK objects into other rendering software that maybe have exposed more parameters to get this effect?

So, are you talking about using Blender?
